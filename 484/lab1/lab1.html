								Well it looks like Ray Kurzweil was right. It seems just like yesterday when we were
								first hearing of his radical predicitons in his self-authored book	<i>The Singularity is Near</i>.
								But here we are today 10 years later and wake up to find out that indeed it has happened.
								Two reasearch Universities in Fantastic Land have indeed created a machine that can redesign
								itself in the event that it needs to as well as program other machines better than itself.
						 		This is great news for the advancement of technology. Soon we'll be able to send unmanned
								missions to space and colonize planets or the machine <i>might</i> turn rogue. To be completely
								honest the only thing I fear is that my programming job <i>might</i> be in jeapordy: who would
								want to hire a human when a computer can do it? Here's hoping that my career stays relevant
								until I retire.
								Regardles, what a time to be alive!

								This year is shaping up to be <b><i>the</i></b> year in terms of computational advancements.
								Earlier we achieved the singularity just as Ray Kurzweil had predicted 10 years earlier and
								today we find out that F-Wave (not to be confused with <a href="http://www.dwavesys.com/">D-Wave</a>)
								has released a new Quantum Computing processor codenamed four-two. The news comes from what
								seems to the be <i>the</i> hotbed of technology: Fantastic Land. A team of researchers there
								collaborated with F-Wave to create a new manufacturing process that enables the mass production
								of Quantum Computing processors for mobile phones. This is great news in terms of crazy fast
								computation in such a small package. In the not too distant future we can all just use our
								mobile phones to find if N = NP, all of the prime numbers ever - which would break encryption:
								yikes! - as well as find out if we are indeed just living in a computer simulation!...or the
								sentient beings will make themselves super powerful and wipe out all life as we know it.
								Hopefully that last one doesn't come to fruition any time soon.
