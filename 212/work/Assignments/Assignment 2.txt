5)
<string> = X| <string> <F>|<string> Y
<F> = X|Z

7) 
<word> = R|<D>|<D><word><S>
<D>    = Q|P
<S>    = 1

if the string is of length 1
and the letter is either R, Q, or P
return true
if the string is greater than one
check to see if the string ends with a 1
if it does, call itself and send a string that is
one character shorter than previous to check for R or Q or P
return false if these tests fail

10) is +*a-b/c++de-fg prefix?
No it is not since prefix states

<prefix>     = <identifier>|<operator><prefix><prefix>
<operator>   = +|-|*|/
<identifier> = a|b|...|z
