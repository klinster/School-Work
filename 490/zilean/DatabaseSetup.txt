********DATABASE SETUP for databaseSetup.php********

1. DOWNLOAD: Wamp server for phpmyadmin

http://www.wampserver.com/en/

Click the link above. Go to downloads, and install. 

Run wamp.

To access the server through a web browser, type in the following url:
localhost/phpmyadmin

Default Username should be "root" and password should be empty in the form of ""

Once wamp is installed and you are able to access localhost/phpmyadmin,
save the databaseSetup.php file like this: 

My path looks like this: C:\wamp\www\Zilean
I created a folder Zilean and put it in there.

To run the file, you have to type in localhost/Zilean
It should show the databaseSetup.php file in the Zilean directory if saved correctly.


NOTE: I tried running the databaseSetup.php file without saving it there
      and I have not been able to figure out why it won't work yet.
