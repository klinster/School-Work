# smartmirror
Main application

SmartMirror is an Android application developed by four Cal State Northridge students as a Senior
class project.

It is the software component of an Android-based information appliance designed to bring data
to a unique location in the home as a means of exploring interactions possible within the
"internet of things".

The application shows time and weather by default and recognizes ~90 voice commands using the CMUSphinx
voice recognition library. Additionally, it supports APIs for Facebook, Twitter, takes photos and stores
them to the cloud, tracks and displays emails and weather alerts, and can display full news articles
using the Guardian News API. It will enter a sleep state on command and can be woken by command or
the integrated light sensor. The display is customizable, with various display modes to show or hide
content panes are desired.

In addition, the accompanying 'smartmirror remote' project provides an application to control
the mirror with an Android device via Wifi.
