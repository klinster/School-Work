Lab6: Daemon

How to get current working directory from calling process.
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/298510/how-to-get-the-current-directory-in-a-c-program/298518#298518

====================================================

DESCRIPTION:

Two programs written in C. One is a daemon - spritid.c - and another - mole.c - is a simple program that emits one line as output. The daemon creates and kills child process. These two programs will act as a whack a mole game whereby the daemon "whacks" a "mole" based on the signals being sent to it.

NOTE: For the purpose of this lab the lab6.log is created in the lab6 folder.

USAGE & SAMPLE OUTPUT:



====================================================

CHANGELOG:
v0.1.4 Edit the make file.

v0.1.3 Catches signals but the logic is wrong for making a mole during the signal. Mole works. See NOTE in the Description section.

v0.1.2 Figured out that exec isn't working through debugging. Still not working

V0.1.1 Mole is now writting to lab6.log, Daemon is not working still.

v0.1 Initial Commit - Got most of the daemon written but it's not daemoning. Mole is done.
